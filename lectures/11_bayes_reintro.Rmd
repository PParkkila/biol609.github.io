## Discussion: Key Points from Chapter 1
### All models are wrong, some are useful!  

So, how do you see modeling data? Is it:
![](./images/11/many_paths.jpg)

or is it building a model by using science to think about a data generating process, an error generating processing, and going from there?  
\
What is the difference between these two approaches?  
\
\
One set of hypotheses does not imply one model. One model is not derived from a single hypothesis. What is a case in your own research where you have encountered this conflict? How can or would you resolve it?

\
\
OK, so given this, why are we using a Bayesian approach?  
    - What advantages or disadvantages does it have relative to a frequentist approach?
    - Compare drawing counting the number of ways things can happen based on our information versus comparing current counts to how things might have been with a large number of samples  
\


## Let's see how Bayes works
\
I have a bag. It has 6 stones in it. Some are black. Some are white.  
\
I'm going to draw stones, one at a time, with replacement, and let's see the number of ways that the draw could have been produced.  
\
After 4 draws, let's calculate the probability of W white stones and B black stones. Let's formalize how we made this calculation. This leads to conditional versus marginal probabilities.  
\
Now, I will look at the stones, and introduce a prior or some sort for W.  
\
Let's do a new set of draws, but this time, on the board, update our posterior.  
\
And finally, relate this to the definition of Bayes theorem in 2.3.4 pg 36.  


## Now, let's do this in R with Grid Sampling!  

Let's use `dplyr` and mutate for the following. You chosee what fraction of stones is white or black in a bag of infinite size:  
\
1. Define a grid of possible values from 0 to 1.  A column in a new data frame.
\
2. Define a prior. Your choice as to its distribution!  This is the second column of your new data frame.  
\
3. Now, what is your posterior after 1 random draw using your chosen fraction of white stones?  
    - Remember, posterior = likelihood*prior/sum(all posterior values)
\
4. Use this updated posterior to do a second draw. And a third. And a fourth.  
\
5. Plot each posterior with updating.  
\
6. Now, instead of doing it step by step, assume you've made 100 draws given your initial prior. What does your posterior look like?  


## Introducing rethinking  
This is from the Rcode on page 42, box 2.6. Assume 100 draws.  
\
```{r rethinking, eval=FALSE}
library(rethinking)

#alist is a list for used to define a model
draws_mod <- alist(
  #our likelihood
  w ~ dbinom(100, p)
  
  #our prior - can be something else if you want!
  p ~ dunif(0,1)
)

#define the data - you fill in the probability
draws_data <- list(w = XXX)

#We will use map - maximum a posteriori sampling
draws_fit <- map(draws_mod, 
                 data = draws_data)
```

Now let's explore our output
```{r explore, eval=FALSE}
precis(draws_fit)

summary(draws_fit)
```
