- To share polls and code

- Can use for collaborative note-taking

- Research shows that this enhances learning!

- It's also a way to ask me a question during class

4. Rethinking everything 


## Model-A-Palooza
  
**Objective 1)**	To learn how to think about your study system and research question of interest in a systematic way and match it with a realistic process-based model.

## Enter The Reverend
  
**Objective 2)**	To understand how to build and fit complex models in a Bayesian framework.

## The Rest of Your Life

**Objective 3)**	Provide the grounding needed to effectively collaborate with statistical experts.  
  
**Objective 4)**	Allow students to gain the knowledge necessary to become life-long learners of data analysis techniques, able to incorporate new techniques into their analytic toolbelt as needed.

## Bayesian Inference

<font size="6">

-   Estimate probability of a parameter

-   State degree of believe in specific parameter values

-   Evaluate probability of hypothesis given the data

-   Incorporate prior knowledge

## Let's see how Bayes works
\
I have a bag with 6 stones. Some are black. Some are white.  
\
I'm going to draw stones, one at a time, with replacement, and let's see the number of ways that the draw could have been produced.  
\
After 4 draws, let's calculate the probability of W white stones and B black stones. Let's formalize how we made this calculation. This leads to conditional versus marginal probabilities.  
\

## Let's see how Bayes works...
Now, I will look at the stones, and introduce a prior or some sort for W.  
\
Let's do a new set of draws, but this time, on the board, update our posterior.  
\
And finally, relate this to the definition of Bayes theorem in 2.3.4 pg 36.  

## Let's do this in R with Grid Sampling!  

Use `dplyr` and mutate for the following.   
  
0. Chose what fraction of stones is white in a bag of infinite size.  
\
1. Creat a column of possible values from 0 to 1.  
\
2. Define a prior as the second column.  
\
3. Calculate your posterior after 1 random draw, then repeat for draws 2-4 plotting your posteriors    
      * posterior = likelihood*prior/sum(all posterior values)  
\
4. Plot your posterior given 100 draws, given your initial prior. 

## Introducing rethinking  
This is from the Rcode on page 42, box 2.6. Assume 100 draws.  
\
```{r rethinking, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(rethinking)

#alist is a list for used to define a model
draws_mod <- alist(
  
  #our likelihood
  w ~ dbinom(100, p)
  
  #our prior - can be something else if you want!
  p ~ dunif(0,1)
)

#define the data - you fill in the probability
draws_data <- list(w = XXX)

#We will use map - maximum a posteriori sampling
#Note, I use rethinking:: in case you've loaded purrr
draws_fit <- rethinking::map(draws_mod,
                             data = draws_data)
```

## Now let's explore our output
```{r explore, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
draws_fit

summary(draws_fit)
```
