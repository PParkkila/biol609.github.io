## First, SomeNew Technology
https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/609-intro

- This class will use collaborative note-taking

- Research shows that this enhances learning!

- It's also a way to ask me a question during class

## Model-A-Palooza
  
**Objective 1)**	To learn how to think about your study system and research question of interest in a systematic way and match it with a realistic process-based model.

## Enter The Reverend
  
**Objective 2)**	To understand how to build and fit hierarchical/multilevel models in a likelihood and Bayesian framework.

## The Rest of Your Life

**Objective 3)**	Provide the grounding needed to effectively collaborate with statistical experts.  
  
**Objective 4)**	Allow students to gain the knowledge necessary to become life-long learners of data analysis techniques, able to incorporate new techniques into their analytic toolbelt as needed.

## Modeling So Far: General Linear Models
$$\boldsymbol{Y} = \boldsymbol{b X} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}$$

```{r iris_plot}
ggplot(iris, mapping=aes(y=Sepal.Width, x=Sepal.Length, color=Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method="lm") +
  theme_bw(base_size=17)
```

## Foundational Modeling Approache

1. What is your data generating process?  
  
2. What is your error generating process?

## Foundational Philosophical Approaches

> - **Frequentist Inference:** Correct conclusion drawn from repeated experiments  
>     - Uses p-values and CIs as inferential engine  
\
> - **Likelihoodist/Information Theoretic Inference:** Evaluate the weight of evidence for different hypotheses  
>     - Derivative of frequentist mode of thinking  
>     - Uses model comparison (sometimes with p-values...)  
\
> - **Bayesian Inference:** Probability of belief that is constantly updated  
>     - Uses explicit statements of probability and degree of belief for inferences
