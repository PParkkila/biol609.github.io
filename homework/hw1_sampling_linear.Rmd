## 1: Sampling from a binomial
a. Choose a # of observations and # of tosses of the globe that land on W. Start with a probability of 0.8.  
b. Use grid sampling to get a posterior with your choice of prior that is *not flat*.  
c. Give point estimates and uncertainty of the probability of landing on W. Make an informative plot.   
d. Create a model check. Did your model checks show you were all good?  
\

## 2: A Linear Model
With the Howell data on the !kung san - `data(Howell1)`  
a. Subset to between ages 0-20  
b. Intelligently evaluate your priors. Show that you have done so!
c. Fit a linear model using `rethinking`.  
d. Show checks of assumptions  
e. Show the fit with both fit and prediction intervals.  
f. For extra credit/fun, look at the whole dataset and repeat with a nonlinear model!
